How to Propose your Contributions
=================================

The easiest way to do so is to create a pull request on
GitHub or a similar platform (currently this project is
hosted by GitHub).

Also opening an issue and submitting a patch is possible,
but pull requests are easier to do, especially because there
are tools that work with pull requests (e.g. travis-ci).

Copyright and Contributions
===========================

Having a copyright disclaimer in every file with all the
people that contributed to the file is impossible to
maintain (see `this
<https://medium.com/@giacomo_59737/what-i-wish-i-knew-before-contributing-to-open-source-dd63acd20696>`_).

Therefore there is a file called ``contributors.yml``. This
file contains a list of annotated lists with all the
necessary information. Add yourself to the list and add an
item for every contribution you make. Also there is still
``git`` that logs all the contributions.

Run ``make print-contributors`` before committing and
pushing your contributions to ensure that the file is valid.
